## Analytical Query I: Top five sales reps with the most sales broken down by year.
```{sql Retrieve top five sales reps with most sales broken down by year, connection=mydb}
SELECT 
    year, 
    rep_rank,
    rep_name, 
    total_sales
FROM 
    -- Nested Subquery
    (SELECT 
         year, 
         rep_name, 
         total_sales,
         -- Increments the rank if the current row is in the same year as the previous row (@current_year = year),              otherwise resets it to 1 for a new year.
         @rep_rank := IF(@current_year = year, @rep_rank + 1, 1) AS rep_rank,
         -- Updates the @current_year variable to the current row's year for comparison in the next row
         @current_year := year
     FROM

    ) AS ranked_reps
WHERE 
    rep_rank <= 5
ORDER BY 
    year, rep_rank

## Analytical Query II: Total sold per year per region.
```{sql Retrieve total sold per year per region, connection=mydb}
SELECT 
    region, 
    year, 
    SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales
FROM 
    sales_facts
GROUP BY 
    region, year
ORDER BY 
    year, region
```
## Analytical Query III: Total sold per quarter per year. Show the result in a line graph visualization.
```{sql Retrieve , connection=mydb}
SELECT 
    year, 
    quarter, 
    SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales
FROM 
    sales_facts
GROUP BY 
    year, quarter

    year, quarter
```
## Visualization
```{r}
